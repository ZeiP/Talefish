# Talefish
[Talefish](https://www.github.com/jgibbon/talefish) is a directory based audio book player for SailfishOS.

One of the main goals of Talefish is to provide a place to listen to your audio books separated from the system media library. Of course you can use it for other audio files like podcasts you've already downloaded.

Be sure to check out the application options by using the main page pulley menu. 
Some of the current features are:

- Remember listening position â€“ even if you've opened another directory since
- Custom Playback Speed (within the limits of qml Audio)
- Metadata support for most common file types
- Album Cover support for most common file types with fallback for image files in the currently opened directory
- Skip forward/back by predefined durations or swipe the album cover area to skip to track beginnings
- Slumber sleep timer integration: Rewind a bit if Talefish is paused by slumber
- Open files from other applications by using mimer
- Open files/directories from the command line (-e to enqueue to current Playlist)

Hint: Create a file called ".nomedia" in your main audio book directory to keep the SailfishOS media library (tracker) from indexing it if you don't want those files to show up in the default media player.
